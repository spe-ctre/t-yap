# TYAP MOBILE PRD

## Project Overview

TYAP is an innovative digital transport payment solution designed to revolutionize the way passengers, drivers, and park management handle fare payments and related services. The platform combines biometric authentication (via thumbprint), a mobile application, and value added services (VAS) to create a seamless, cashless, and efficient transportation ecosystem.

The TYAP system automates transport fare payments by enabling passengers to pay through thumbprint verification on TYAP biometric devices installed at motor parks, terminals, and within vehicles. Each passenger is registered on the TYAP mobile app, which links their biometric data to a secure digital wallet.

Through this integration, passengers can easily pay fares, access VAS offerings such as airtime and data purchase, bill payments, insurance, and micro savings, all within the app while eliminating the need for physical cash transactions during transport.

## Product Goal/Objectives

The primary goal of TYAP is to digitize and simplify transport fare payments by leveraging biometric (thumbprint) authentication and mobile technology, creating a cashless, transparent, and inclusive transport ecosystem for passengers, drivers, and park management.

TYAP aims to bridge the gap between transportation and financial technology, providing an all-in-one platform that makes mobility payments seamless while enabling users to access value-added financial and lifestyle services.
